      report_congestion command only when Design Compiler is running in 
      topographical mode or the physical flow is enabled in DC Explorer.

   o  The scripts execute the report_missing_constraints and report_design_mismatch 
      commands only when the shell is running in exploration mode.

Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

The DC Explorer compatible version of the script marks Synopsys logical database 
(.ddc) blocks as physical hierarchies only when Design Compiler is running in 
topographical mode or the physical flow is enabled in DC Explorer.

Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

For the DC Explorer compatible version of the Design Compiler Reference Methodology 
scripts:

*  A comment has been added that can guide you to identify and report instantiated 
   clock gates in the Clock Gating Setup section.

*  The DFT configuration has been updated to set the set_scan_configuration
   -preserve_multibit_segment option to false. 

   This command treats the cells inside a multibit component as discrete sequential 
   cells, which improves scan chain balancing.

*  The autoread flow has been updated. 

   The read_file -autoread command has been replaced with the analyze -autoread 
   command and the corresponding elaborate command to generate the Formality 
   autoread RTL script without the set_top command.

Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

The UPF files for full-chip RTL UPF and full-chip mapped UPF are no longer generated 
because hierarchical multivoltage verification is now performed using Formality 
power models.

Common Changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

The autoread flow has been updated to execute the set_top command for the reference 
container from the fm(_top).tcl script instead of the autoread RTL script.

Unique Changes in fm.tcl
------------------------

For hierarchical multivoltage verification, power models are now created for each
hierarchical design.

Unique Changes in fm_top.tcl
----------------------------

G-2012.06
=========

The following sections describe new features, changes, and enhancements in the
Design Compiler Reference Methodology version G-2012.06.

General Updates
---------------

*  The hierarchical flow now supports physical guidance.

*  Support has been added for IC Compiler block abstractions.

*  Scan compression is now enabled by default when you include a DFT flow.

*  Design Compiler and the reference methodology scripts now create supply set 
   handles by default.
   
   The primary, default isolation, and default retention supply set handles are 
   created when the power domains are created.

*  A comment about how to access Visual UPF in Design Vision has been added.

   You can use Visual UPF to generate an IEEE 1801 template for your design. 
   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

*  The dc.upf file has been updated to include the following examples:

   o  Example 1: UPF using supply set handles and supply sets
   o  Example 2: UPF using domain-dependent supply nets


Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

*  The DCRM_DCT_SPG_PLACEMENT_OUTPUT_FILE definition has been included, as a
   comment, to enable the standard cell placement output in the physical
   guidance flow.

*  The DCRM_FINAL_SELF_GATING_REPORT variable specifies the name of the report file 
   for the XOR self-gating results.

*  The DCRM_DFT_DRC_CONFIGURED_SUMMARY_REPORT variable has been removed.

   Only verbose reports are saved. Summary reports for dft_drc are included 
   in the Design Compiler execution.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  The ICC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS variable has been defined to list IC Compiler
   block abstraction hierarchical design names.

*  A comment has been added to set upf_create_implicit_supply_sets to false when 
   your UPF specification has domain-dependent supply nets.
   
   By default, the tool creates supply set handles.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The -congestion option for the compile_ultra command has been removed from 
   the flow.

   You can use physical guidance instead.

*  The physical guidance flow now supports ASCII output of the standard cell 
   placement information for input to the IC Compiler Reference Methodology. 
   
   This capability requires an extra Design Compiler Graphical license or an 
   IC Compiler Design Planning license. To enable the file creation, uncomment 
   the DCRM_DCT_SPG_PLACEMENT_OUTPUT_FILE variable definition in 
   dc_setup_filenme.tcl.

*  You can now use ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE}, ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, or both 
   to constrain the design. The tool reads both files if they exist.

*  Ports being created during insert_dft are added to path groups to improve
   optimization results.

*  Information about how to use enable XOR self-gating has been added to the script.

*  Information and an example that show how to create timing constraints for 
   serialized compressed scan have been added to the script.

*  Core Test Language (CTL) test models for IC Compiler block abstractions are now 
   read in to ensure that the design-for-test (DFT) information is present.

*  Information about how to use Shared Codec I/O pins in DFTMAX has been
   included in the script.


Common Changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  IC Compiler interface logic model (ILM) support has been added for the 
   hierarchical multivoltage flow.

*  User interface changes have been made for leakage and dynamic power optimization.

*  A new option, Pin-Limited Compression, has been added to the RMgen interface 
   on SolvNet.

   Set this option to TRUE to insert serialized compressed scan, which is 
   recommended to improve the ATPG quality of results (QoR) for designs or 
   blocks with a limited number of top-level scan ports.

*  Information has been added about forcing IEEE 1801 supplies for Formality 
   verification in UPF flows.
   
   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).


Lynx Compatibility 
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference 
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the 
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  You can now specify the list of IC Compiler ILMs when using a hierarchical
   multivoltage flow.

*  You no longer need to add IC Compiler ILMs to the link_library variable.  
   The tool automatically finds IC Compiler ILMs that are included in the list 
   of Milkyway reference libraries defined in common_setup.tcl.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  Reference methodology generated error and warning messages now have the
   following prefixes: RM-Error and RM-Warning.

*  The -type option has been added to the set_multi_vth_constraint command used 
   to limit the number of low-threshold-voltage cells in the design.

*  The commands used to enable leakage power optimization and dynamic power 
   optimization have been changed:
 
   o  set_leakage_optimization true
   o  set_dynamic_optimization true

*  For a multicorner-multimode flow, dynamic power optimization is now scenario 
   independent and you can enable it in the main Design Compiler script.

*  The write_environment -consistency command in the multicorner-multimode flow now 
   uses the correct tool command language (Tcl) procedure name, dcrm_mcmm_filename, 
   instead of the incorrect name mcmm_file.

*  Support has been added for pin-limited scan compression.

   Set the new Pin-Limited Compression option to TRUE if you want RMgen to generate 
   scripts that include serialized compressed scan insertion in a DFT flow with 
   adaptive scan.


Unique changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

The hierarchical multivoltage flow now includes scripting that supports IC Compiler 
ILMs in the flow.


Changes in dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl
--------------------------------

* The set_scenario_options command no longer includes the -dynamic_power option.

* The set_max_leakage_power command has been removed from the leakage scenario.

  You should use only the set_scenario_options command to define the type of 
  scenario for optimization purposes.


Common Changes in fm(_top).tcl
------------------------------

Information has been added about the verification_force_upf_supplies_on variable.

*  The default value of this variable has been changed to true in Formality 
   version F-2011.09.

*  Set this variable to false if you want to revert back to the previous 
   verification behavior for UPF supplies.
